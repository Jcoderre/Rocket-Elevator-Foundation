# Rocket-Elevavtor-Fondation
Contains all code for Week 10 Test Driven Development of Odyssey.

#### TDD

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed.

### Test-driven development cycle

> Add a test

> Run all tests and see if the new test fails

> Write the code

> Run tests

> Refactor code

> Repeat

#### Week 10 overview

This week I've implement an API that give Rocket Elevator a display of Daily News in our Elevator.
We stack them inside de SPEC file for test to know whats up with the new API I try to implement in our Code. 
After those test for the API I've test various things around my code to better understand the TDD.
I have run test using Factorybot on user creation and tried Capybara .
I have installed Simplecov for a better understanding of my test and to get a better overview.

#### Gem Added

 > SimpleCov
